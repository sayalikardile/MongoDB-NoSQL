348177453,1398182941,The more I use it  the less I like it,What were the powers in charge thinking. They took an app that needed improvements and made it worse. I now use a separate quote app and only go to Fidelity for trading. It's a shame that it so cumbersome and difficult to navigate. I have found the supposed 30 minute timeout is sometimes as low as 15 minutes before I have to sign in again making options trading troublesome. Don't be fooled by the glitz.

348177453,1397578965,Very Disappointing Iteration,It takes longer to load  and that's the best of the worst.   The new iteration defaults to a feed (which is probably why it takes longer to load). It is the default landing tab and cannot be replaced.  The feed is entertainment when this app should be all business. Even the counter for one's balances (clocking through) is unnecessary eye candy and a metaphor for the wrong bias of this design.  I want to know balances and to be able to trade and research  not see what an algo thinks I should see. I want to see credit card transactions (still not available in mobile)  not just payments and rewards  Back to the feed: I don't need to know about random movers (I have triggers). Among those random citations are  for those of us with managed accounts  obscure holdings over which we have no control.   Some people may want a feed. It's even fine if Fidelity wants to make one the initial default. Experimentation is noble. But I should be able to turn it off  and replace it in the nav.  Even then there would be the matter of unnecessarily longer load time  but I'd live with that. But if I could role back  I would.,1,2016-06-21,John C Abell,39272667,https://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewUsersUserReviews?userProfileId=39272667

348177453,1398739059,not customizeable,Why are the icons at the bottom not fully customizable?  I just want to remove the useless feed default page and replace it with the accounts page as default?    Also its way to gimmicky for a financial app - when showing the account balance  it counts up from 0 to your balance.  Are the games really needed  can't you allow that as an option if people want to see the numbers flipping?    The large font size can't be controlled which causes little information to be displayed on the screen and makes you scroll all the time to get to information.  Again  could you allow customization to choose what size font should be used?,1,2016-06-19,Mr Sunshine two,32771538,https://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewUsersUserReviews?userProfileId=32771538

348177453,1395009220,Now completely disorganized  slow and confusing.,"The latest version is absolutely horrendous. They have now put everything everywhere  completely random and disorganized information. The screens are slow to load as a result.  In my last trade  the ""last price"" shown in an order was 15 min old even though I was logged in.  I was provided a notice that my offer limit price was ""above"" the asking price AFTER the order was sent.  This update is nothing short of a disaster.    New update - still very unstable  slow  forgets username  unreliable  poor quality coding on the iPhone.  Now it won't allow me to log in. This app works so poorly it will cause you to lose money. Fidelity if your programmers can't make a decent app you need to pull it.  Update -   Fidelity thanks for fixing the freezing and the forgetting of logon information. There are a few additional items I have noticed that I hope you can fix:  1. Add a cash management tool so you can see when your trades will clear and you will have access to the cash. I got a violation because this app isn't providing sufficient information about the cash in my account available for trading and then it is letting me place orders. Why are you letting me get a violation ... You guys are the gatekeepers and make the rules. Don't let your app process the trade!!!   2.  When selling  you have j put the last price in the trade order screen. Make that price dynamic so the user can see it changing when entering limit orders.  3.  Please notify users of special fidelity fees ie in the case of a fund being sold prior to a mandatory duration.  A general warning is not specific enough!!  In general  it should not be riskier to trade with this app than the desktop because the app is buggy or provides less clear info.

348177453,1394717640,SO SLOW & TOO BUSY AFTER UPDATE,Fidelity does better than most banking apps but gosh you overhaul the whole app UI and the FONT IS SO BIG you can only read 4 transactions at once! The content you are actually interested in reading ONLY USES 1/2 THE SCREEN  since the content is the focus why not make the top bar and bottom bars go away? This increases the utility of the app - which should be the goal. Overhauling a UI that was already pretty good does not add a lot of utility. Focus on how many taps a user has to make to complete an action in the app too! Too many steps for simple functions and news feed loading etc.. Come on! Anyway at least 2 stars since Fidelity actively works on improvement to their product  that says  A LOT right there but comeon with the minimal value add for all the work.

348177453,1390097672,Okay  but...,"While the update does modernize the user interface  the feel is not as considering as the prior iterations. One pet peeve is the scrolling count-up of the account balance is really cheesy!  Also  my long standing gripe about how mutual fund daily gain/loss during the trading day is displayed still exists. I think that the current day gain/loss for mutual funds should be zeroed out at the start of the trading day. Mixing the prior trading day's gain/loss for mutual funds with the current day's gain/loss for stocks really skews the totals. At the very least the total gain/loss shown should use the ""Today's Change"" from the positions page.",4,2016-06-06,High Technology,14824502,https://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewUsersUserReviews?userProfileId=14824502

348177453,1387924193,Some good.  Most bad.,"Good: 1 Finally futures quotes. Would be better if they had own tab and were not delayed. But I will take this as a first step.   2 Easier to see outstanding orders. Trading screens are improved and cleaner.   ***Bad: 1 Overall loading information seems to take much longer than old app. I hope this gets worked out in future updates. Cannot deal with reading ""loading"" as frequently as I have to at this point.   2 ""Feed"" is too cluttered. Too cute for my use. Please let me disable that tab and add one more useful to me. (Another plug for a separate futures tab). One tile/card takes up almost the entire screen for a single stock.  There should also be an option to exclude mutual fund holdings from the feed.   3 Watchlist font/spacing needs work. I wear bifocals. Yet I still find the spacing on the watchlist to be overkill. I don't need equity name. Space between rows could be smaller to allow more information on a single screen. Like the Feed  too much empty space.   4 Accounts tab. I can see balance in an account on main screen. Then for some reason I have to wait for the cute odometer count up when I look at an account to see holdings. It's only a half second or so.  But that's enough to get me to move to a diffent app to monitor my holdings.  5 After hours price updates also seem hit or miss.  Refreshing my accounts proice flips from prior close to pre market price and back.  Annoying.  ******If you use this once a day  the changes are probably fine. If you use this more frequently to trade/monitor  this is not for you. I know Fidelity has a different customer base than IBKR. If they want to keep the more active clients that have  this will not do it.   Please make a mobile version of Active Trader Pro.",2,2016-06-02,ChuckAppReview,35512006,https://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewUsersUserReviews?userProfileId=35512006

I really feel like I'm getting a great point-of-view at a macro level with this app.  One thing that I haven't seen from any of the financial investment apps that would truly separate this app from the rest of the competition would be unbiased news stories from the local markets media. For instance  South China News puts out quality articles on the state of the Chinese and Hong Kong markets that I don't get with any American companies.

Second  whoever signed off on the ""Feed"" idea is out of touch.  Fidelity is not Facebook.  Nobody is going to care about the garbage in that feed.

You can't change the font so far as I can see   Also while I am waiting to see what my account balance is the number rolls up like a winning slot machine and that makes me nervous.  I think it makes me nervous because I am afraid the number will stop well below what I expect.   Luckily I haven't experienced this on a poor day for the stock market so I can mentally prepare myself    I have been a fidelity customer since I was 19 years old.

The good-the interface looks  feels nice and modern  definitely a departure from the old app. Most of the functions are the same.  The bad-I use fidelity for my brokerage accts  my cash management Acct and my fidelity credit card. I have a few Huge complaints that need to be addressed ASAP 1) bill pay-very primitive and takes way too long to post to the account. There is a portion of the day on the day after the payment is initiated (on standard 1-2 day bill pays)where the payment simply vanishes From record. It's not in pending nor is it in posted. I have panicked once and made the payment again during this period  only to realize my original payment posted the next day. I like the chase model the best for Bill pays  the second you initiate the bill pay  the second it should come out of your available balance.

However  there still is a considerable gap in logic relative to bill pay  available balances  EFT deposits are generally taking way too long to be credited  and it's super confusing as far as understanding available balances for bill pay.

348177453,1386871516,Decent app- technology still far behind competitors,"This app looks good. The problem is it follows the old Wall Street saying ""put some lipstick on the pig"". First there is too much real estate used for  the iPhone 6. There is no font or column adjustment. I currently have 7 positions and can't see them on s single screen. In the old app I could. They also continue to ignore the basic fundamental requirements of a mobile trading app  such as real-time updates on all positions and trades. If you add to a position  the current day pricing information goes away!! Unbelievable  unheard of in today's trading apps. Also no ""Close Position"" option on a sale. You must type in the basic  information before hitting send  unbelievable! On a new buy  the trade screen doesn't display ""funds available to trade""  you need to know or remember to look it up before going to the trade screen! Once you set up a limit order and the bid/ask price changes  it doesn't update the limit price  you have to re-type it! By far the most frustrating issue remains the antiquated technology platform  specifically the lack of true realtime position updates.

Nice emerald Fidelity green color changed to swamp/poop green. Why? Graphic 'designers' justifying own existence? And then getting thumbs up for reverting it back? 2.

348177453,1386050167,Unable to zoom,Current version is very bad - you can't pinch to zoom. It's 2016  and seriously they updated their app and took this functionality away. They did some nice features  for example there are now some more useful columns like 52-week range in the portfolio history view  but this just makes usability worse since you have to scroll even more to see everything instead of being able to zoom out and see everything in one view.,1,2016-05-29,JimChou,118758047,https://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewUsersUserReviews?userProfileId=118758047

348177453,1385540766,I still prefer the older app,Been a regular user of old app   was hoping improvements with this update but so far it seems to be a dissapointment.  1. Fonts are way to big  and screen real estate management is poor  to look at my positions / account summary i have to keep on scrolling on and on..previous app had a much better and useful compact display. 2. That shuffling slot machine like numbers dancing around for 5 seconds are so annoying when you go to detailed view of any account. Cmon this is not video game get rid of it please. 3.account summary is what i want to see first instead of news feed when i login first .

348177453,1385441989,You guys blew it...,Lol  what did you guys do? The new feed makes it cumbersome to look at my day and the transparency is incredibly distracting. The UI also feels way too white with the only color (green) coming off the tabbar and logo. And who decided to modify the Fidelity green? It's a little baby-poopish  don't you think? Man  the design agency you guys went with must've had an amazing pitch because the result is pretty bad. It's not totally unfixable but you definitely have your work cut out for you.

348177453,1385595066,Bad update,This is just awful. Where to start? I ran the App and it starts with the “Feed” page with a moving image of the New York skyline at night in the background and translucent white areas with text on the front. The image showing through the text areas makes the text hard to read. The whole feel of the App is a very bad Twitter or Facebook like experience  we’re not all Twitter and Facebook addicts you know?

348177453,1385065873,Beautiful app!,Fidelity knocked it out of the ballpark with the new update-the old version was good but could use improvements and Fidelity delivered with the update.

348177453,1385037842,Two Features Please,The new application is very nice  but it still doesn’t have the two most important features I’ve been asking for recently in these reviews.  Please consider these for the next update:  First request: Please allow two account login profiles to log in to the app via Touch ID. Currently only one person may log in under their login profile  but when a second person later tries to log in under their separate login profile  it isn’t initialized for Touch ID  so they must re-type their password and re-setup Touch ID.  Then with the first person returns  same problem  they have to reinitialize Touch ID again  which defeats the purpose of the quickness of Touch ID and delays placing trades at critical moments.  Need to be able to toggle back and forth between two Touch IDs without having to keep re-entering passwords every time please.  Second request: Please display the “limited margin” balances for IRAs in the app.l as is done on the full webpage. This is a critical piece of information that is missing for mobile users. Currently the app only displays cash balances  not the full detailed balances that include the “limited margin” balances such as limited margin credit  intraday  and overnight.  This would be more in the keeping of the spirit of the new app to have the balances displayed the same way they are on the full webpage.,5,2016-05-28,Reshma Thompson,234768998,https://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewUsersUserReviews?userProfileId=234768998

348177453,1385049793,Should have left well enough alone,Well  Fidelity managed to gee whiz the usefulness right out of their mobile app. What was once relatively clean  quick  and easy to work with is now slow  involves extra steps  and is totally annoying.

348177453,1339741457,Very nicely done,This is a really great app for me  so easy to use  especially when compared to several other banking apps I've used in the past. Admittedly  I don't engage in frequent trading  but when I do it certainly isn't letting me down  very user-friendly. Good customization of the home screen  accounts are easy to quick check  and the fingerprint login is a big plus for me. An app that had all of the functionality of their website would surely be prohibitively unwieldy  but I think this is a really good handheld offering with more than just the essential functions.

348177453,1340989842,Poor Features,The information pertinent to my account is poor. The layout and content is insufficient to make a quick decision about the status of my portfolio. There is irrelevant information displayed. The format is not as useful as some other free apps. The features are not as useful as what is included in their other platforms.

First  the watchlist doesn't stay selected in the widget. Second  and most importantly  I noticed that using the widget is sucking the life out of the battery. This started with the latest update. I checked this by looking at how much Fidelity was using of the Battery in the Settings  both with the Fidelity widget on and off. These need to be fixed asap.  Update 3/5/16: Battery issue fixed(thank goodness!). Unfortunately  the widget still keeps losing the watchlist I select. Am I the only person having this problem?

You offer the most basic functions compared to other Brokers and even then you fail to properly configure the app so that it doesn't crash and freeze every time you try to look something up. It's really pathetic that you can't even provide a decent app experience. The charts show basic price charts  whereas on TD you can load up to 5 different indicators to make educated trading decisions.

Fidelity is late to game for Mobile-first solutions for retail-working-day traders.  For example  app now has option info but placing a multi-leg option trade could be better done on a slate by a goat than your app. IMPROVE IT!!  Option Pairing - options are treated as individual security with no tie in whatsoever to other legs or underlying long or short stock position. I can know whether leg 1 has increased or decreased x% but practically useless for multi-leg options.  Alerts - alerts work but they could be easily set and refreshed (especially ones which are price-triggered as opposed to EMA or MA)  I can write about few other defects but let's first get these fixed !!

348177453,1129886149,Nagging issues still,Version 2.5.19. I was logged in to Fidelity while using the app.  A disturbing quirk in the Home => Markets display where current value  day change  and percent day change reflect the closing values for the last session. I have a screen shot with the date/time stamp at the bottom that clearly shows that the display was refreshed at 9:43am. The chart correctly shows about 13 minutes of activity  but the values displayed to the right are closing values for the last session. Refreshing the display updates the chart but not the values. I navigated to this screen several times and sometimes got the current market numbers and sometimes values for the last session - although the chart always reflected the current day.

348177453,1101355380,Really enjoy fidelity,After seeing some other negative reviews of this app  I thought that I should weigh in. I have been a long time user of Fidelity for both my brokerage and checking accounts and have used the app for several years now - just to give you some perspective.  The app is great. I have not experienced any blurring of text as has been mentioned in another review (I have a iPhone 6 plus). Additionally  I'm not sure what that other reviewer was referring to regarding the minimum for check deposits. My wife and I make check deposits all the time for small amounts like $10 or $20 and have never had any issues   That out of the way  the app does everything that you would want it to with relative ease. Check your balances  make a trade  do some research. It's all quite accessible.   Fidelity is also very on the ball in terms of updating their app. Just this year they've updated it at least 3 or 4 times making improvements to the app each time  Download it. Use it.

The number just disappears after you press the second digit because in Spain the decimal separator is a comma instead of a dot. You can't continue without entering the amount so the whole check deposit is useless. As a workaround until this is fixed  you can change the regional settings in your iPhone.

348177453,897748492,M,I've had accounts at Schwab and their mobile app is vastly superior.  From  ease of use with regard to information on positions (i.e. Cost basis on individual lots/ dividend re-investments) to a simpler screen to read.  Also  the ability to take care of simple administrative items such as turning on and off dividend re-investments or other tasks was easily done via the Schwab mobile app.  The Fidelity app needs some serious work.,1,2013-11-27,CPS120,35840646,https://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewUsersUserReviews?userProfileId=35840646

348177453,887334831,Needs some work,A better quotes/watch list giving bid/ask would be helpful.  Easier transaction menu from already purchased stocks/options would be great(buy/sell/increase position/decrease position  etc.). Options lists definitely need more work  as it's very difficult to navigate the site and find the options menu quickly. Additionally  the call/put options for any stock should not be as close together as they are… It's very easy to tap on the wrong one when trying to select action on one option.  A scrolling menu of choices/selections would be better for every parameter (i.e. buy/sell  call/put  buy to open  buy to close  sell to open  sell to close  etc). By contrast  TD Ameritrade's app is extremely functional and usable and it eliminates these chances of mistakes. Additionally  getting logged out every 30 minutes is frustrating. Login time should be customizable in increments up to eight hours and then let it automatically log you out.,2,2013-11-19,chiroruss,41456676,https://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewUsersUserReviews?userProfileId=41456676

The latest update 2.02 provides limited ability to compare the performance of two investments  but the timeframe can't be changed. Also  colors such as red and green lack saturation.

348177453,710423104,Loathing the updated interface,With the flashy color  shiny round icons  and green dot vs red dot simplifications  it seems the developer wants to make managing a portfolio more like playing a low-tech game for preschoolers. Meanwhile  the font size of the information which truly matters  the numbers on the Positions tab after the Subaccounts headings under the Accounts page (which by default is the third swipe from the opening screen) is absurdly tiny. It's hard to see on a phone  and as a result I have gone back to my laptop to manage my accounts. I truly regret installing this update and wish for an Undo feature on the whole experience.

348177453,709836404,Lousy update,The updated Fidelity app  in my opinion  is ugly  dark and harder to use compared to the prior version. Eliminating the navigation buttons at the bottom of the screen in favor of the new navigation bar at the left makes it harder to use. Now you may have to tap/slide multiple times to get to the navigation. Putting the box to enter a symbol for a quote right below the log out button was just dumb; I have logged out accidentally enough from this.  The account display was far better in the old version; you could see at a glance price changes in securities without having to scroll or tap on individual stocks in your portfolio. Similarly  in the old version there was a nice  clean chart of the major indexes on the home screen. Now  there's an ugly screen with only current data; to see the chart you have to tap on each index  one at a time.   I primarily use the Fidelity app to see my account positions and market action  to check stock quotes  and to trade  and this update has made all of those things frustrating.,1,2012-12-12,Jeremy4665,223025422,https://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewUsersUserReviews?userProfileId=223025422

348177453,690000837,No iPhone 5 support,The app seems to work well so far. I actually chose Fidelity as my broker based on the relative lack of negative reviews of its iOS App (e*trade and TD Ameritrade had absolutely terrible App Store reviews -- Fidelity's App is reviewed slightly better). Almost all of my trading will be mobile  so the usability of the iOS App is a make or break part of the deal for me.   The only complaint I have after a few days use is the lack of full-screen support for the iPhone 5. Really  Fidelity: you're a major brokerage house  with all manner of resources and employees.

348177453,690235892,No iPhone 5 support,I concur with the other current reviewer that if an application comes out and upgrades with support for iOS 6 the assumption is it also supports the iPhone 5. This is not the case here as it still has black on the top and the bottom so it obviously still only supports the iPhone 4 display.   I guess they just tested to make sure that running under iOS 6 did not give them a problem. Without a description here at the iTunes store I cannot tell what other enhancements there are if any.  It is nice that at least the app takes advantage of some of the iPhone 4S enhancements that carried over to the iPhone five such as SIRI so that you can speak in stock ticker symbols to get a quote.  What continues to make this app invaluable to me is its ability for me to deposit checks without having to go to a Fidelity branch.,4,2012-10-09,JoelIrwin,149843299,https://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewUsersUserReviews?userProfileId=149843299

348177453,414827255,Doesnt guarantee privacy accuracy,The Agreement required to be signed before using the app states Fidelity is not responsible if the transaction gets intercepted and your privacy is breached.  If their encryption fails you are still responsible!  Anything else they do wrong you are completely responsible unlike if you were using your home computer.  I dont know if this would hold in court but it certainly doesnt give a warm and fuzzy about the mobile app if they absolve themselves of all and any responsibility.  They also dont guarantee the accuracy of data they display or whether any orders can be executed correctly.  I can understand if you are not careful with your password or mobile device and somebody else gets a hold of it and is able to do a transaction you should be liable.  But they should at least take responsibility for losses if their encryption doesnt work and they breach data security.  The agreement also says you have to call them after a transaction to get a printed copy which is different than if you were using a home computer.  With a home computer you can set it so that you get written confirmation of all your transactions.,1,2011-01-22,enbeng,165663219,https://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewUsersUserReviews?userProfileId=165663219

Multi-tasking is a very important feature of iPhone. It was developed for the reason of switching between apps without the hassle of shutting one down to open another one up. The problem with this app is every time you switch out of it it logs you out and you have to log back in.  This is a hassle when your trying to make a timed trade as it takes a minute every time you log in.  Very annoying and time consuming.  Talked to app development about it and he said it was a valid complaint and would be fixed in the next version but was not.  Td ameritrade is a much better app as it will keep you logged on.

348177453,340207104,Working but needs cut/copy/paste support!!,This app is working pretty well for me but has a -major- usability problem: no support for cut/copy/paste!  There are many usage scenarios this makes difficult here is just one:  I trade options and I subscribe to some directed trading newsletters. These newsletters specify numerous option symbols to be traded. What I want to be able to do is copy each option symbol to the clipboard then get onto the Fidelity app and paste a symbol into the option trading screen.  Not being able to do this is a major pain because I have to keep bouncing back and forth between the app and the email trying to remember the symbols (which are more complex then stock symbols).  Of course each time I have to do this I have to log into the app again!!  Another place copy/cut/paste would be huge is inside the app itself.  If I look up an option chain inside the app I should be able to copy option symbols from there to other places like the quote screen or the trading screen.  If copy/cut/paste support was added throughout the entire app it would be 5 stars!,3,2010-09-21,AudioTappiAl,100247169,https://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewUsersUserReviews?userProfileId=100247169

Best of all ITS FREE!   I bet dollars to doughnuts that the bad reviews were paid for by someone over at Etrade. Why would anyone with a Netbenefits account want to check it all of the time? Netbenefits only updates once a day! If you want an icon that badly then make one using Safari.   Note about Etrade. They are a publically traded firm who lost a ton of money during the subprime debacle of 2008. Clearly they are getting deaperate otherwise why write such horrible reviews?

348177453,228313754,We have been Fidelity customer's...,...for fifteen years. I was wondering when they were going to release an app for the Iphone. It's not perfect but it gives us a good overall picture of our accounts. Haven't tried the quote feature yet during market hours but it's probably delayed quoting. Charting is pretty good but the app doesn't include all the technical charting indicators available on the website. Overall it's a good app-not great-but just enough for us to get a picture....,4,2010-03-10,Tboomer,35946968,https://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewUsersUserReviews?userProfileId=35946968

348177453,227812905,Security concern,There is no way to turn off the autofill on the account or social security name.  That means the phone is storing my social security number and associating it with a brokerage account.  Seems like a very bad idea if the phone is lost or stolen.  Other than that it seems like a useful way to interact with Fidelity.,2,2010-03-09,Whoseit,40116830,https://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewUsersUserReviews?userProfileId=40116830

348177453,227477322,Shocked at limited Features,I'm very surprised that a large investment company like Fidelity would come out with an iTunes app that has such limited features.  I can't see the history of transactions??  Other investment/banks have apps with history but not Fidelity??

Can't automatically remember your login info (so you have to type your password each time you load the app...i know it's for my own good) b. It's not remembering the settings I've made (i.e. customizing my home screen layout) c. Forces you to view the non-customizable home page they've set up each time you load the app.  Other than these issues thus far the app looks and acts great! Trading is intuitive and seamless.

428599191,1397261741,Need some improvements,Although I do use this app and will continue to use it I will say it needs some major upgrading and improvements. It often doesn't give you credit for some items that you know you qualify for. If you have several items on the same receipt you shouldn't have submit a different receipt for each item.

428599191,1384487571,WONDERFUL!!!,This app is amazing because I get electronic rebates on products I purchased. The item can be on sale and I use a coupon and still get a rebate on top of that. I am from the old school where 30 years ago I would have to fill out a rebate form then cut out the UPC from the product. There was the cost of stamps and envelopes then wait 6 weeks for a check which had to be taken to the bank. This app is amazing. All I have to do is choose the product I want a rebate on then use my customer loyalty card to make the purchase and in a few days the rebate is in my account!!!! It can't get any easier than this!

Twice now I have verified my activated offers by scanning barcodes at stores.  When I submit my receipts I have got emails that none of the products I have bought qualify for this.  Twice now I have not been credited 5 $ on bounty plus a few more 1 $ rebates.  It's frustrating to see this when Ibota and Checkout 51 have been flawless.

428599191,1378370512,ALL TIME FAVORITE!,Absolutely amaaaaazing app! I've literally been paid hundreds by SavingStar by both in-store and online shopping. This is tied with IBotta for being my fav rebate apps. I LOVE that their are so many familiar items to purchase and most of all I love the wyb offers and weekly freebies. It's hard to beat FREE! Many items can be purchased for free if paired with a manufacture coupon. And many great items such as Dove reset to buy again each month. Customer Service has been amazing whenever I had an issue. They always honor my requests no questions asked. One time I accidentally used a new CVS card which I forgot to link to buy the $5 wyb $15 Doritios and they gave me the credit anyways. Another time I was only a few cents short for another spend deal and they gave me full credit for that as well. Thank you SavingStar and Great Job!!!  P.S. The only request I have is to make online shopping available through your app AND increase the cashback availabilities and percentage as well. Oftentimes you do not have the store I am looking for whereas other sites do. You are also not usually the highest offers available and in my opinion you should be because you ROCK the hardest and dominate the coupon/rebate world so it seems like you could afford slightly higher offerings to keep your customers loyal.,5,2016-05-14,MelissaRn333,142243474,https://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewUsersUserReviews?userProfileId=142243474

428599191,1380057180,Really frustrating slow support,"Ok. It's nice to get money back and support is always polite. However in the last 2 months every single ""one or many"" purchase has been added incorrectly requiring me to contact support which now takes an extremely long time to address the issue. Additionally linked card store purchases are simply being missed so credit is not being given. Other times a receipt will sit in the queue for weeks while others are processed requiring another note to support. Again they are always polite but it might take weeks to get your rebate processed. If you have lots of patience and enjoy contacting support then I guess the app is ok.

The customer service was always prompt and resolved any issues I had. Now it takes FOREVER to hear from them (at least a week or longer). And the stores that are SUPPOSED to be automatic saving stores either take forever to show up or only partially credit me for my purchases. I am STILL waiting to hear from customer service (it's now been a week) because I'd bought two things from a store and only got credit for one.

428599191,1376909615,Slow response times scanner from Stone Age,If you buy more than one of an item(ex: 2 cans of beans) the scanner won't accept the 2nd item.  I've had several receipts that were not completely accepted even though I followed the rules TO THE LETTER. When you contact support be prepared for a looooooong wait. Example: my request submitted today received an automated email saying the next response will be in 5-10 DAYS! Honestly go with Checkout 51 or Ibotta before you use this.

Long wait times and don't even think about emailing them. I don't see why 1 store is instant and another takes up to 2 weeks it's crazy and makes no sense. Along with long wait times they are constantly wrong about your items they credit u for. So many times I have to wait up to a month for full credit because they are wrong. They make u email then wait and wait and wait. Heck you should get credit just for that. Ibotta is way better faster and 100 times more accurate then this app. If u use be warned!!!,1,2016-05-11,Lola 1111123211,24798183,https://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewUsersUserReviews?userProfileId=24798183

After about a dozen tries in different light & at different angles I actually got three green check marks when scanning!  Then the talley only showed one item so I still couldn't collect the offer.

428599191,1373515322,It's okay. Not the best..,It's an okay app. One of my least favorite since it's the least one I used. I can't used it a lot since I don't buy a lot for the one or many offer. I live on my own. I hate linking the loyalty card because I have to used the barcode on the app instead of my phone number. I lost a couple rebates that way because I forget to scan the barcode on the app instead. Lastly I tend to forget to activate the offer. Since this app was not useful to me I check once a week when new deals are up on Friday and don't check again. Sometimes I would find items that I always buy and it's available for rebate but I'm not eligible since it was not activated. Please change these issue. It makes things less complicated and less difficult to use. But if you're getting money back for something you're already buying. A little bit goes a long way.

428599191,1369638802,Excellent,I have been using this app for over a year. Tie it to a Saving Star American Express and get 10 percent for buying grocery items at store. Many times the camera on your phone may not work as efficiently. I had an old iOS 4 phone and recently upgraded and things are much easier !  Customer service is there but can you imagine checking and deciphering somebody else's cash register receipts. I have had some issues before and all were resolved. It is tied to cvs also. I also buy on line going through saving star and have saved so very much. This is at Walmart Best Buy Home Depot and hundreds of others. It is just not groceries. So check it out carefully. I did not use it before because I did not have enough practice. Be patient. You do get the monies. I put in my PayPal account and it helped me with my taxes as I am on a fixed income.

428599191,1367640168,Good app,Good app for the most part. I've noticed that if you claim fruit or vegetables then the other groceries don't always show up as you getting the rebate. The other groceries scan and say they added but then you don't receive the rebate even though they are on the receipt. I've been using this app for over a year and it has happened multiple times. I don't like the new scanner either. You have to have it just right in order for the light on the scanner to turn green. Sometimes I spend 10-15 minutes trying to get only a few things to scan.

428599191,1360898797,Ok App,It takes a long time for credits sometimes 4-7 days. You really have to keep an eye on the credits because they are constantly missed. I've emailed their customer service many times and they take 5-7 days. So to get a $1 credit it can take almost 2 -3 weeks for it to be credited if it's missed. I haven't been able to view My Account tab in the app for weeks. Customer service says to view it online...obviously not how an app should be used.

428599191,1360299901,Overall an okay app.,I don't use this app as frequently as I use other money saving apps because the offers are fewer and only certain stores are accepted. I really wish you would add the commissary to your list of stores. I would probably use the app more if you didn't have the store restrictions. It would also be beneficial if you had more ways to cash out.

428599191,1359497604,Not pleased,I've been an avid user of savingstar for a few years now because it's so easy. Load your store card number with coupons shop and earn. In the beginning the app took forever to do anything. Then for probably the last year everything seemed much more streamlined. This newest update forever has sent the app back atleast 4 years. Slow to load each part of the app no organization on the first screen of coupons. I liked having my activated offers separate. I can never see my earnings. My only gripe before this update was how long receipts took from stores like target. Now it's everything such a shame.,2,2016-04-06,Megk823,109200565,https://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewUsersUserReviews?userProfileId=109200565
428599191,1358432138,Not bad but losing other coupon opportunities,I've been using the app for about 6 weeks. I like the savings. I find the products relevant to what I purchase and like the that there is the opportunity to save on fresh produce. I wish my grocery store was not one that required you to scan their loyalty card. Now I have to choose between using the app or using the electronic coupons I can attach to the store's app. You can't combine the two.,3,2016-04-06,PaBean,424769775,https://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewUsersUserReviews?userProfileId=424769775

I always get my money quickly and I've never had a problem that they couldn't help me with. However this new update is hard to deal with and is the reason I'm giving 3 stars. The app takes FOREVER to load and it lists the items in a random order. Sometimes offers that I need to activate are below offers I've already activated and it makes it easy to miss.

It's actually become so much more time consuming that I have come close to giving up using it all together!  The scanning technology is horrible. I often spend 10 minutes or more trying to get barcodes to register (my average submission is 3 items). I've had to contact customer service on multiple occasions to get proper payments for submissions. In some instances I've abandoned the submission process or not bothered with disputing rejected claims because the hassle is not worth the 25 or 50 cents.  I consistently wait anywhere from 1 to 3 weeks for my submissions to process. Crazy. In contrast Ibotta processes and credits rebates in 1 day or less often in less than 5 minutes!!!

I don't like how ""new offers"" are not on top anymore - we have to scroll down to find them hidden in-between all the offers - perhaps there should be a separate section of the app for new offers.

I have been able to save a lot with this app.  It takes a while for items bought at Harris Teeter to be rewarded but they eventually come through.

Other cards have linked but honestly with the requirement of having to buy $15 or $12 worth of product to get a rebate (even a decent one) it's not worth it. I don't need or want $15 worth of pie filling or creamer. With many of these items if I am going to venture to try something new and change my buying habits (which is presumed to be the goal of these apps) I don't want to buy enough to feed an army without knowing if I'm even going to like it.

I was going to delete the app because I don't use it much but wanted to reach my cash out limit first.  I submitted a receipt with 6 rebates equalling $6.25.  I did not use manufacture coupons because I wanted the rebates to cash out.  Took 12 days to process my receipt then I didn't get 2 of my rebates equaling $3.50 ..and what do you know I'm 25 cents short to cash out.  Sent a message to customer support...no response. I'm not waiting for that other 25 cents it's getting deleted now.   Save your time and frustration.  Get ibotta and mobisave.  Best two out right now and NO problems with customer support!!  Update:  customer support got back to me and gave me my money back so I kept it.  However several months down the road and they are back at it again.  If I submit one item per receipt at a time there are no issues.  If I have more than one they ALWAYS leave off at least one offer.  This time it was for both beech nut baby food.  1) ""spend $15 get $4"" 2) ""buy 5 natural or organics get $1"" I spent $15 PLUS got an additional 5 jars to be on the safe side.  They gave me the $1 but didn't give me the $4 for spending $15.  I've had it.  Saving star is the only rebate app that I have to contact customer support to get the money back that was promised.  Honestly don't waste your time.  They need to hire better staff to look at the receipts and give back what is promised without the hassle of contacting them every time!  Update #2: Once again rebates were not given to me and with no explanation.  What is sad is that I sent them an email when I submitted the receipt telling them ""because I have had numerous problems getting my rebates in the past I'm letting you know what is due to me.  You can check the receipts I submitted for verification."" After sending the email scanning all barcodes and submitting my receipt I got 2 rebates out of 6.  I sent them another email saying they were a joke and once again I am missing rebates.  The ONLY reason why I have kept the app is because I do save money when items have multiple rebates (same item on ibotta saving star checkout 51 etc). And because although I have to email them numerous times I eventually get my rebates.  If I do not get them even 1 time the app is gone and I will find a way to report it. ????",1,2016-03-17,Blueeyedlove,408246101,https://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewUsersUserReviews?userProfileId=408246101

428599191,1348390339,Takes forever and rarely works,I don't understand why anyone uses this app especially if they've tried Ibotta. You have to wait days to find out if your receipt is approved and once you hear back half the time it's not. You have the option to resubmit but that receipt is long gone. Ibotta gives approval within minutes and their barcode scanner actually works. The ss scanner usually doesn't work and when it does it often says it's not a qualifying item even it clearly is (this has happened repeatedly with larabars).  Anyway try this and Ibotta.

428599191,1350757948,Reasonable,I like that the offers are switched out about once a month with a weekly produce item and a few others throughout the month - no rush to redeem yet you know new offers are coming.  I like that some stores work with the keychain discount cards so you avoid the hassle of photographing your receipt ...but if you forget to scan the keychain you're out of luck because they won't let you add it after the fact.  I've had mixed results with redemption.  Good luck with produce and single item redemptions but real issues with the one that require a cumulative purchase.  If you are vigilant though customer service will credit you eventually if you can prove you bought enough.  Overall it's worth the time but it's not a huge money saver like some of its competitors but it's also not a flash in the pan.

I've noticed a quirk with the bar code scanner when I try to see if one product qualifies for an offer; either the bar code will scan within a few seconds or it won't scan at all.  I've also seen inconsistencies when scanning for example a code that scans and at first reports the item does not qualify then scanning it a second time results in a positive response.   I would also value the ability to sort offers by their expiration.   Perhaps a ""scan as you go"" utility to track your own progress toward the ""one or many"" promotions would be useful.  This way we can avoid purchasing too many items in our attempts to make the redemption.  Sometimes I'd like to remove items from the shopping list also.

IBOTTA Checkout 51 Mobi Save Ebates are much easier to use and VERY quick with their payout. Same day credit! Love it!  I have been very unhappy with this app. since it has upgraded but unfortunately not upgraded its customer service.  Almost each week if I submit a receipt something is wrong or not credited correctly.  The most saddening complaint is the amount of time it takes for payout. A long time passes in order to receive your $ in account and almost always when you scan a product that clearly should qualify based on the description of it ......it doesn't. So many better coupon apps. that are quick clear and very easier to use. Not This One! I have been a loyal user for over 2 years and I am seriously rethinking this app.,1,2016-03-06,Mrs.B5th,116048267,https://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewUsersUserReviews?userProfileId=116048267

428599191,1342274984,By far the worst rebate app,This is by far the most problematic rebate app I have used.  I have a receipt that clearly shows I bought 2 of an item and they said that i don't qualify for a rebate because their app only said I bought one.  I contacted their customer service 4 times about this and finally got a response that they are correct. Basically I think they make it hard to claim rebates so you give up.  If I ever get this sorted out and get $5 I am not going to use this app anymore.  It is not worth the hassle. With the new update it is also really hard to scan upcs.  You have to get lucky to get any upc to scan.

My favorite email so far after the ten day waiting period was  an automated email that stated ""we have not forgotten about you."" That was a month ago and the rebate is long expired. I read other reviews where they were told the store logo was missing or the date was missing even though it was clearly there. That seems to be my issue as well so I even send a screen shot of the app showing all this information from my receipt in their app. Still no answers or rebates. Their customer service is a joke. I've only gotten one reply back crediting me $.50 for my troubles when I'm actually missing $19 in rebates.

Also in the past I've purchased items that are valid and the UPC won't read as a valid item.  I've had the app for around 4 months and had to contact customer service 5 times.  I'd say those odds are not great!  When you contact customer service or should I say lack of customer service you get nothing.  I had to go to social media to get a mediocre response that then referred me to contact the same crappy service if I had more questions.

428599191,1340153574,Needs adjustments,"I preferred the old version. This version is not in ""about to expire"" order and i truly hate that. Also if a store is ""scan card"" only than that needs to change. If a card does not get scanned or the scan turns into an error issue but is not noticed until well after the trans is done there should be an option  to enter the info like the non scan card stores. Cust. Service needs to hurry their butts up bc 5-10 reply on a question is beyond ridiculous. This version seems to take longer to load and the earned option always fights with me to load so i have issues seeing where my earnings are at. I do love that we do not need $20 minimum to cash out and the offers are always what I use and so many others use which is fantastic.

Of the six receipts I have submitted in five weeks HALF have come back not having given me credit for an offer and the receipts are clearly legible and the products are correct. Then customer service takes more than a few days which they warn but is still annoying. Comparatively I've been an Ibotta user for 20 months and have only had two issues that were promptly resolved.

428599191,1338941542,New app version comes with an infinite amount of frustration,"So I've been using SS for awhile now. They just updated the barcode scanner and I rarely can Make it work.  I will literally try for 10 min to scan one barcode. Lately I am having more luck but that doesn't mean much.  Still when you can't scan a barcode 40% of the time it is frustrating. Also and here is a big tip: make the phone light Come on when taking a photo. Mobisave and others do this and the picture it takes is CLEAR!! Also I emailed cust service about above problem 2/13/16 and received a 2nd automated response today saying they will get back to me and haven't forgotten about me.  I've contacted them three times and one of the three I got a personalized answer within 2 days. The other two? Not so much. 10+ days of no answers. Although I will say from a customer service point of view it is nice to get an email that says ""we know u r waiting and haven't forgotten"" type thing.   There are great benefits to this app and they have great cash back offers with lots of variety. I like using stores that I can link a card to BC then I don't have to snap a pic.  That's the biggest plus. I also like you can get your money in increments of $10. Not have to wait till you hit $20 like many.  So overall a 5/10.  The technology has got to be updated especially when smaller companies that do rebates have got the technology to take a clear crisp photo of the receipt.  Go to the old version of scanning the barcode!! That was much better!!!! Easy!  Ibotta has it to where you just barely point it in the direction of the barcode scanner and it works so fast!

428599191,1333560917,Good but could be ( a lot) better!,"I've been using Saving Star for a while but the same problems exists & have not been addressed. Often there are products that offered but aren't recognized by the app. For instance  there was an offer for Charmin mega roll toilet paper. When I purchased it from Target the UPC code wasn't recognized. I took pictures of the item & the  barcode & submitted them.  It took over 2 weeks for support to respond. When they finally did they issued me a ""courtesy credit"" while saying I didn't purchase the item in question. When I questioned that response they never responded. Over a week ago I purchased an item that also didn't scan.  The only difference between that item and another that did scan was that the item I chose had a bonus amount of 35% more (at the same price). I took pictures of both & submitted them and I'm still awaiting a response. I recently submitted a receipt of an item that I purchased before I 'd activated the offer .  It was denied less than 24hrs later. I suggested (more than a few times) that have a way to submit & address the items that I've described with just as quick a response. Once you activate an item you cannot deactivate it.  This matters because most of this items have max number of redemptions. I accidentally activated an item once but couldn't undo it.  It was something I had no intention of buying. A couple of times I've tried to activate item that have reached their max.  There is no way of knowing what the max is or whether or not those activations are actually redeemed.

That being said I despise this update! Honestly it was perfectly fine the way it was before and now it's become much more clumsy to navigate around the app. The display is all wonky looking under the account button. Oh and it won't let me cash out. It says that I put in the wrong password which I know is incorrect.  Also I tried to submit a receipt and it kept crashing over and over.  VERY frustrating when there are time restrictions on when you can submit for these offers. One suggestion for the next update add a search bar so we don't have to scroll through all the offers.

I received an immediate response from them that I would hear back in 5-10 days.

428599191,1319063959,Too Slow to Verify Purchases,This app is getting worse instead of better. Way too slow in verifying purchases and crediting your account especially when you manually upload your receipts. The slowest coupon app to verify and give credit. Customer service is extremely slow in responding to issues or giving a status. More stores are now requiring you to manually upload your receipt so their manual process being so slow becomes more and more of an issue. I'm a long time user but other newer apps blow them away as far as processing and giving credit.

428599191,1320697395,Used to love savingstar,I used to love this app it helped me save so much money... Let's you redeem at $5 which is nice and low... But lately it's almost always repetitive offers. When they do have something I want to buy I purchase things in the picture that verify as participating products when I'm in the store and get denied. Tired of communicating with customer service so unjust let it go. Also lately take 10-20 days to process my receipts. Unfortunately all the store near me other than cvs are receipt stores. Which means I'm waiting decades to get any info whether I will be approved or not. By then we have ate the products or discarded the receipts and can't dispute anything if needed. I love anything that helps me save on my grocery bill... Just wish they had more variety... Maybe baby stuff would be nice and wish they reviewed and had a faster turn around 10-20 days is just ridiculous if they're that busy and can't do what they promise it's time to hire more staff...

Love it so far I did have a couple issues with getting some rebates back. I purchased the items in a one or many rebate and when I scanned the item after several days of not getting a rebate back it said not eligible :( but the rebate didn't say it was specific on the items just buy the brand stated. When I emailed about the issue I got a timely response back and I sent a pic of my receipt and product and explained that the rebate doesn't state it was only on certain items so they gave me the rebate within 24 hours!

Seriously there are easier ways to get proof then the one in place now. I mean most receipts these days come with barcodes. Why can't we just do that? Isn't that how the loyalty cards work?

And a 5-10 day response time for requests is too slow. I am going to cash out what I do have and delete this app because it's actually causing me to lose money because I am buying things because of the deal and not getting refunds.   Since I started using this app I have been getting only partial refunds. The correct items were purchased and verified and clearly noted on the receipt yet they are not applied. I have contacted the customer service and I get a response that my purchase did not meet the requirements. If it's save $1 off 2 boxes of Chex cereal and I bought 2 boxes of Chex cereal how did I not meet the requirement? Same thing with two Betty Crocker items?

428599191,1307665859,See the name!,SavingStar is wretched. 100% wretched.  First they are slow in posting your money and it takes them 2 weeks to even respond to your emails.  You purchase an item that is listed only to scan it to submit the receipt only to be told it's not eligible.  Yet it is the EXACT same item.  This has happened multiple times.  Save yourself the headache and download Ibotta instead.  They are great! You get credited your money in minutes the longest it took was an hour probably because I had a lot of items.

428599191,1287834091,One of My Fave Savings Apps,I'm a big fan of SavingStar.  If you shop at any of the SavingStar card linked stores like CVS you don't have to bother submitting a receipt.  The rebate money just shows up in your account a few days after you shop.  You do have to make sure you select the offers you want as soon as they come up.  The better offers like those for cosmetics go very quickly.  As soon as an email comes through from SavingStar telling you there's new offers go to the app and select them!  Then you know for sure you will get the rebates once you have time to shop.

428599191,1287136388,Very limited,"I have used other rebate apps with no problems but I have had issues with uploading receipts using this app. It is hard to see where the receipt 'pieces' end with long receipts because of the app's words and jagged edges in the way. My first two receipts were rejected because 'information was missing' (not). Info was there but all the edges were not lined up perfectly. Will likely delete because so far it isn't worth my time. Additionally it takes much too long to be paid.  Many of the coupons (rebates) are listed as ""One or many"" which is incorrect. For those items they require that one spend anywhere from $12 - $30 worth of a product to get rebates. Thus MANY items must be purchased. The items rarely change as well.   One of the biggest disadvantages is that one can only buy items at a very few stores. For example one major grocery chain in my region is not one I can get rebates for. There is a weekly ""healthy option"" rebate where they rebate 20% of the cost of fruit or vegetables.. So spend $1 on bananas for example and get .20 rebate.",1,2015-11-16,Terrysan11,15297034,https://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewUsersUserReviews?userProfileId=15297034

428599191,1285113699,Great Money Saver but Always Crashes,This app saves me money which I love I have used Savingstar for as long as I can remember but the submit receipt section of the app needs some SERIOUS work. It regularly crashes on me mid-entry while I am taking the photos of my receipt. Sometimes even multiple times where I give up on entering a receipt or postpone it for another try later. This is such an annoyance and time waster! It's annoying enough to have to scan everything that you've purchased and take pictures but when it crashes and you are doing it multiple times hoping for success it's barely worth doing. Please please fix the receipt entry crashes! It only seems to happen on my iPhone not Ipad and especially for longer receipts.

428599191,1273886349,❤️ Savings Star ⭐️,Would give 4.5 if it were an option not quite a 5-star app yet.  I've used this app now for several years periodically and just recently started again.  It's improved so much  over time and is finally an app I would want to use on a more regular basis. A few problems here and there with getting it to accept some barcodes for particular items but in general this app just keeps getting better & better!!

428599191,1277117198,Could be great if they can get act together,I've been using Savingstar for a while now and behind Ibotta they easily have the largest number of rebates that are relevant to me.  However the user experience leaves a lot to be desired.  I can't think of the last time I submitted a receipt that went through on its own let alone in a timely manner.  Constantly having to contact customer service because receipt was rejected or an item was missed.  No easy mechanism to resubmit receipts they deem unreadable (even though same receipts were fine in other apps) and response times have slowed significantly.

But once I did the research and email SavingStar for help it is a piece of cake! It did take several days to resolve the problems I had by the way I created the problems by not reading the instructions properly they were more than helpful in fixing it for me. I shop at Publix and CVS a bit and do not have to do any kind of submitting. It is done automatically! All I do is cash out when I reach the minimum or let the dollars keep building!

You have to scan the UPC's you purchased then photograph your receipt which if it doesn't fit into one photo you must take multiple photos. The problem ... I have submitted the same receipt multiple times even went as far as to highlight the items I purchased that qualifies for savings/refunds. Checked to make sure all information was legible and store and date was showing clearing ---> reflected every time now the offers have expired.

428599191,1259773765,Started out fine...,The app itself works fine. No problems there. It seemed cool: just show your receipts and get money back. Simple right? The problem is that after my first cash out every time I submit a receipt I am given some bs reason they won't accept it. They say the date is missing. No it's right there if you'd bother to look. Store logo missing. What do you think the big circle at the top with the store name is then? They take weeks to write you and tell you this so usually I've already tossed the receipt and can't resubmit. I started underlining and highlighting parts of the receipt with stars and arrows to point things out. Oh the receipt's too blurry to read now. Funny how it's sharp enough that I can read from the image without even zooming in but they don't have that technology I guess. Waste of time.

428599191,1249256726,Great if offers are for products you shop for,I've had this app for over a year and earned an extra $35 on items I normally purchase.  I have never had an issue with an item being created but you have to have patience. It can take up to 3 weeks (like they say) to be credited. I hate having to hold onto receipts in case something is missed but I have not had an issue yet.  It's easier to use than other apps no snapping barcodes and copies of receipts just scan your loyalty card at checkout.

428599191,1247536811,Waiting for more improvements,I loved it when I first started using this app. Seems like it takes longer for the receipts to go through especially the ones you have to spend $20 or so. Even though I have been using it for awhile now the account history only has two or three transaction recorded on there it has not updated at all. I don't mind taking a picture of the receipt but having to verify and scan all my products gets old especially when the app shuts down or my camera doesn't work and I have to start the WHOLE process over again!

428599191,1244493919,Great concept but.......,"There aren't a whole lot of rebates to choose from & its mostly stuff I don't buy anyway so my potential savings is low. Second why can't the rebates be used at any store like some of the other rebate apps and then I've purchased items at an approved store only to realize after I got home that I had to have a loyalty card for that store so I bought something I wouldn't normally buy and then never got the rebate. No savings there! And third and most frustrating as mentioned by another reviewer is that a rebate looks ""legit"" meaning that it appears that you'll actually get money back so u buy the item and try to redeem as soon as u get home only to find out that the limit has been reached. I contacted customer service about this in the past. All they did was apologize & say that they try to remove items from the list as soon as they r no longer valid but I've seen items remain on there for weeks after it says limit reached. Sometimes it'll say it when ur looking thru all of the offers but other times everything looks good until u actually try to add that offer to ur list.

428599191,1241044471,Definitely not my fave savings app,I have tried several other savings apps and this one is my least favorite to work with. I was not fully paid for the first 100% freebie offer I tried the app seems to take quite awhile to process and credit your account while others pay within 24 hours and I hate the activation requirements. This app allows you to activate an offer before you purchase the item and then once a certain number of activations have been met you can't take advantage of that offer anymore. My problem with that method is that just because you activate an offer it doesn't mean you will take advantage of it. AND the offer is still being displayed on the main page leading you to believe that you can use only to discover that you can't. This has messed me up a few times now I just go and add everything to my list that I might possibly take advantage of knowing that I probably won't use quite a few of them but I have to play their game.,3,2015-08-10,Holly I.,211771757,https://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewUsersUserReviews?userProfileId=211771757

I had one that didn't take off of a card & after contacting SavingStar & sending a picture of my receipt they credited my account. I especially like the deals where when you but $40 of different items that you get $5 or $10 back. Update. I still like this quite a bit but there are glitches.

428599191,1227113824,Frustrating...Very Frustrating!!,After going out of my way to purchase items that had an offer... Yes you guessed it I never received the promised offer. It was a store with a loyalty card linked to the app so you cant even submit a receipt. Not just one item but 10 items that i never received credit for. You will get some offers but for me it is more like 1 out of 5 that actually work. If you are going to offer something like this please...please make sure your app/system works properly.

428599191,1221093397,Great app!,Love this app and website! Great customer service BUT (and this is why I went from 5 star to 3) it is taking much to long to get a response these days- over 10 days is way to long! Scanning receipts has become more difficult in the last month where I have had to redo receipts multiple times. Also some of the offers are very frustrating for example oranges or lettuce. Not all stores especially big box stores like Costco or SAMs sell loose produce- what is the difference if I buy 3 loose heads (that I put in a bag) of lettuce or 3 already in a bag? Putting restrictions on offers like this is discouraging to your users. When offers have reached the limit please move them change the color or remove them- it is also frustrating to click on offers and have pop ups come up that they are not available.   Awesome that there are offers that are not just processed junk foods.   They are very reliable for pay out I have saved and received over $100 already.,3,2015-07-06,StephNJ,167899636,https://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewUsersUserReviews?userProfileId=167899636

Also would love to see more items for older people to purchase. Now they're making it that you need to buy a very large quantity to get many of the rebates.

428599191,1197432370,Used to be great now not so much,"Positives: FAST turnaround and great customer service. Good variety of offers for products that are NOT obscure.  I like their shopping portal and earn more money from that than from the product rebates I think.   Negatives: used to offer a freebie every weekend. As of May 1st touted their ""freebie anytime"" change as well as pushed their ""get to Gold level to know about freebies in advance!"" Against all odds I made it to Gold level was told of 1 freebie and since then nothing. Not an improvement but a step back. Also not fond of the push on ""one or many"" offers since I don't buy tons of the products they promote. I'd rather have one or two $0.50 offers that interest me than have to spent $25 in Clorox products to earn $5 back for instance.  Also I wish I could use offers at any stores. I shop at Aldi & Save A Lot mostly. I do buy some of the products promoted by SavingStar but since those stores aren't included in the program I can't take advantage of the offers.

428599191,1194740019,The worst rebate app- don't bother!!,This is by far the worst rebate app. They don't process receipts in the amount of time they promise to and do not answer customer service emails promptly either! Still waiting 12 days for a receipt that hasn't even been reviewed and they haven't returned my email. I'm in a Facebook group with thousands of other coupon and rebate app users and everyone is always complaining about how awful Savingstar is. So I am not alone! Buyers beware! And also if any marketing departments of potential products they are thinking of listing in this app are reading this - don't!

I just have to keep re-checking to see if they have fixed it which means I have to keep receipts lying around.   Also if you submit a receipt and forget an item you wanted to submit that is on that receipt they will not take it because the receipt has ""already been processed"".

SS is accessible thru both the app and their website.  When accessing thru the web you can email yourself the offers you have activated with all the details. This is helpful to transfer to your shopping list spreadsheet with your other rebates sales and coupons.   Simply LINK YOUR STORE LOYALTY CARDS and your rebate is automatically submitted. ALWAYS MAKE SURE YOU HAVE ACTIVATED THE OFFER BY CLICKING ON IT  and then checking your list in the app to make sure it appears.  I don't understand why others are having such a hard time with this app.  It's as easy to use as ibotta checkout51 and others.  I usually get my savings within 48 hours paid to my PayPal  account.

428599191,1183544319,Almost $50 so far - YAY,Good app.  Easy to use and many products I would use anyway.  Some issues with Harris Teeter items not being credited and it takes quite a while for credits from HT to post to your account (hence the 4 stars). But Wegman's posts accurately and very quickly so I chalk that up to HT issues not Savingstar.  Been a user for more than a year and I would definitely recommend.  Got to say I don't submit receipts - so I can't speak to that...  look a few dollars is better than none - enjoy the savings you get!

428599191,1125632531,Not worth the hassle- there are better grocery apps!,"Don't waste your time with this one. There are a lot better grocery savings apps. This one takes days or weeks to process. Others apps take sometimes minutes but never more than 48 hours. Half the time when you buy the required purchase in the right time frame you won't get credit. It will say the code is invalid or if you enter a produce code it says not valid. Customer service is ridiculous. You send a message about a purchase that can't be verified and the response is ""we will review your email within 3-5 business days."" That's an unacceptable time frame for  a response especially when so many offers are only good for 2-5 days! Save yourself the headache and download the other grocery savings apps.

428599191,1128409055,Kinda more trouble than it's worth...IMO,I'm disappointed. The grocery store I shop at doesn't have loyalty card so this app is hardly worth the trouble. Why? First it takes a while to scan each item and then you have to photograph your receipts section by section. Then you have to deal with the fact that the app crashes frequently. Frustratingly if you are almost finished with the entire process you have to start over from the beginning bc it doesn't save the data you've entered thus far. This means you have to rescan every item and retake photos of receipt. Basically it will cost you 20 minutes to save 50¢. I'm running ios7 and I've tried updating app restarting Phone and using a different phone. Crashes everywhere. I'm baffled as to why they haven't designed a way to save what is entered so starting over isn't required. My advice:  Don't waste your time.,2,2015-01-07,champ48,113108414,https://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewUsersUserReviews?userProfileId=113108414

428599191,1129403511,Love SavingStar and Love the App!,1/5/2014 Update: I am still loving the SavingStar website and app. I have saved so much money through my grocery purchases and online shopping. I have also noticed that the SavingStar team has been updating and improving the app since I last wrote a review. It makes me feel good as a consumer to see that they are working hard on making their product the best it can be.  I appreciate that I can rely on SavingStar to continue to help me save money in my day to day life. I did have a problem with one of my rewards (the cashier didn’t scan my Hannaford sticker) but customer service was really nice and understanding about it. Thanks so much!  6/27/2014: I absolutely love the new App! SavingStar you did a superb and awesome job! I cannot believe how much improved you have made it the SavingStar team must have been hard at work for quite some time.   I will admit it was a bit of a shock at first and took me a few minutes to get used to it. To whomever is reading this review—give it the benefit of the doubt. I know you’ll come to really like the changes as I do once you’ve had a little while to play with it.   As far as updated features go I love the new list feature. Now when I go shopping I can check items off the list once I’ve bought them so I know not to pick those items up again before my credits post.   I also really like how clean and organized it now is. Before it was very clunky and often would freeze up when I was at the store. It is now a breeze!   Great work SavingStar! It’s really nice to know that you’re hard at work improving the service that I know and love.

428599191,1121329016,Meh- it's been better,I've had this since it spun off UPromise. Yes it has more features now but the processing takes so long to see credits to my account. After 5 disputes I realized I have to keep receipts for three weeks to verify my purchases- especially on the One or Many offers. If you purchased items close to the expiration of the rebate offer it's really hard to track/prove that you should have the credits in your account. I still have/use it but barely.

428599191,1113378022,Don't waste your time,Save all UPCs with a copy of your receipt and a printout of the coupons you redeemed. The app will say items qualify but 2 weeks later the reviewer will say they aren't. If you don't save the paperwork there will be no way to know what they didn't take or what the reimbursement was for. You will need the paperwork to get any credit. As a user for over a year this app has gone downhill fast and I will be deleting it as soon as my payout clears.

You will get emails if the receipt doesn't scan correctly or show enough information. But recently they said that a receipt I submitted was the wrong store. But I didn't even have a receipt for that store. So it would be nice if they had a way I could go back and see what I recently submitted. Sometimes I submit 2 or 3 different receipts in one day so when they say I submitted the wrong receipt on that day we tell which one it was how much it was for or what items were submitted. So when I submit 3 Kroger and 1 Walmart receipts and I get an email that the Walgreens receipt is not valid; am I suppose to resubmit all of the receipts from that day?

428599191,1094632901,sloppy work Apple!,I think Apple is getting sloppy about which apps are 100% voiceover compliant.this app works okay but there seems to be an assumption that those don't see well don't use the camera. So therefore it appears not much effort has been put into making sure that those of us who use voice over have a good fair access to the cameradocument and it would also help when scanning barcodes if there was a audible signal that could alert us home use voiceover that the item was scanned. I don't see how it could be hard to do that since every grocery store that you go to has a beeping scanner.that's why I only give this app three stars. Sloppy work.

428599191,1074287573,SavingStar,I had this app for two years and never used it. The regular selection of products is not that great. Then they came out with the Friday freebie. I get that just about every week. Now it's useful. I have not asked for a payout yet but I have enough that I could. The healthy offer on Tuesdays is pretty nice too though I have only used it once. I have cards for two drugstores and one grocery store linked. Since drugstores have a limited grocery selection sometimes Albertson's is my only choice. And yes they still accept their card even though they will tell you it is not required. So overall I really like the app. (4 stars)  Update (9/24/14): There was an update two days ago but there was also one last month. Maybe that's when I started having trouble with the scanner. It won't work. How am I supposed to redeem an offer at Walmart or Target if I can't scan the barcode?

428599191,1064825767,Mostly Good,This ap is essentially like iBotta and Checkout 51. You scan receipts to earn money back on eligible items. The problem is that SavingStar is late to this party and is playing catchup. Their ap doesn't store a copy of the receipt you uploaded like the others do. That means if you are scanning multiple trips to earn a discount that involves making a number of purchases and there is some sort of problem with an upload it's nearly impossible to know which receipt is the problem. I have had an issue nearly every other time I have submitted a receipt. Of the three aps that I use SavingStar is consistently telling me that I didn't get the rebate or that there is a problem with a submission. Now they are very nice on the customer service side. Issues usually get resolved with an email or two. However it is a huge pain in the butt to have to email them constantly. They need to look at how their competitors are doing the same thing and adjust accordingly. It's a little odd that they have issues because they have been doing this kind of thing longer than either iBotta or 51 just not in a phone based ap. Their menu is a little clunky and it's hard to tell what you have just selected to redeem what is still active that you have selected and what is no longer active. It's hard to tell where you are in meeting the terms of a large purchase offer. All of these things could be improved upon. All they need to do is give Receipt Hog a look to see how to do that right. This ap is OKAY but it has huge room for improvement to bring it up to the same level as everyone else.,3,2014-09-19,TamtamWash,25886815,https://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewUsersUserReviews?userProfileId=25886815

This used to be my favorite savings app but it's quickly becoming my least favorite. I don't feel like it's working correctly. I hope they go back to the old layout.

I've also gotten more than 1 email telling me my receipt couldn't be rewarded when I know I submitted it correctly & all the offers were on the receipt.

428599191,1025388935,Upgrade not working !!,I love this app also but new upgrade on july 10 is not working. I'm confident saving star will fix this shortly in a few days. They added Walgreens target and others so it a big upgrade. Most stores get the money in your account within a day but Kroger could take close to 30 days. I will be anxious to see how this app will work with Walmart when they fix the bug since Walmart does not have a rewards card. The app continues to improve in the last 3 years. I hope they stick around for years to come. I save about $100 a year on top of using paper coupons with this app and there save $5 off $20 type offers are awesome. Keep up the great work saving star.

I would like so suggest that once a coupon has been redeemed if it could be eliminated or changed to a different color or made transparent or moved to the bottom or something.

428599191,985782749,Easy to use but could use a tweak or two,This app is easy. Create an account plug in your store cards choose your offers and shop. There is a variety of product offers available for things you buy regularly. The only improvement I'd like to see is a way to purge expired offers from your list or sort somehow between clipped offers redeemed offers and expired offers. I choose a lot of offers but don't always get to redeem them in time so checking my account becomes a hassle to view which offers actually credited.,4,2014-05-01,seZZaMi,21318715,https://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewUsersUserReviews?userProfileId=21318715

428599191,878449337,Needs major improvements.,I have had this app for nearly 2 years and I still haven't earned $5. The coupons are limited or require you buy a big quantity to redeem the coupon amount. I wish they would add more relevant coupons and more coupons in general. I frequently check the app to ad coupons before going grocery shopping and yet I have not been able to redeem $5 in nearly 2 years; just plain ridiculous!

428599191,741267133,Great concept-limited coupons bring it down.,"What purchase I have made have been credited to my account without problem. The problem is the limited coupon availability. In the several weeks I have used the apps there have been only a few new coupons and there is apparently a ""cap"" on how many users can get each type-the useful ones for me are ""sold out"" by the time I see them so are not available.

428599191,738858693,Just so so,I really like the idea behind this app but it has not worked well for me. If the coupon expires before my account gets  credited I do not receive credit even if I made the purchase before it expired. And since it seems to take weeks to get credit less than half of all the items that I purchase are credited to my account.

428599191,562911685,ONE OF THE BEST APPS I HAVE EVER USED!!,I love this App! This really couldn't be any easier to use - you just register your shopping loyalty cards with SS (I registered five myself) then select only the Coupon Offerings from their assortment that you like/want. From there you only have to remember to purchase your selected items BEFORE the coupons expire and make sure to scan your card at checkout. Once you have completed these three simple steps of selecting purchasing and scanning you will then see the savings amount deposited into (or towards) whatever your election was at registration - within seven days.  I gave this App five stars because of it's incredible usefulness - and the fact that it does just what it states it will do i.e. credit you for your purchases and deposit that money right into your Bank Account or towards whatever you elected. So far I have managed to save almost $20.00 through SS and they have always deposited the coupon savings money into my elected Savings Account within seven days of purchase.  I also wanted to add that the coupon selections SS offers are pretty good. In fact most of the items that they offer coupons for would have already existed on almost anyone's average shopping list i.e. tin foil yogurt paper towels toilet paper cereal candy snacks toiletries household cleaning items etc... etc... Yes - there are some occasional clunkers that SS might offer (I really could do without the magazine subscription offerings!) but overall I have been more than pleased with the Savings Star Coupon Program and it's results!,5,2012-04-22,BetseyD,40839792,https://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewUsersUserReviews?userProfileId=40839792

428599191,463389122,Improvements needed but it works.,It does work. My suggestions for improvement are the following: 1) Allow user to deactivate coupons once activated or after it's used so that it no longer appears; 2) add more coupons on a more regular basis as users have to wait nearly a month sometimes to see new coupons; 3) expand the variety of coupons as many of them I would never use. It can take months to build up enough savings to qualify for a payout if you rarely use the coupons offered.,3,2011-10-13,Guilford shopper,171966900,https://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewUsersUserReviews?userProfileId=171966900
428599191,467004048,Review,You should allow the multiple items of a product to be given the exis amount. Example:Buy Any Pantene full size product & get $1 added to ur savings star account. If bought 3 pantene- you should allow $3 total to the savings. Not only $1... Also would be better if there were more coupons on the list that stores carry. Here in HAWAII we only have Longs Drugs store(cvs) but half of the items on the list are NOT SOLD in the store. Maybe other stores in hawaii added on?,3,2011-10-13,iret808,201065652,https://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewUsersUserReviews?userProfileId=201065652

428599191,428550294,Great way to save money!,I love coupons but dislike coupon clipping. This app is a wonderful way to save money on items that you normally buy. The app is easy to use. I have found many of the coupons are for things that I don't buy and some of them sell out before they expire. I have received the money in my account without delay. The site states that it takes up to a month for the stores to update their systems for coupons to show up. Some of the reviewers have commented about this but you can't blame that on this app. It's the stores that are slow.

406371748,1353089043,There is a transaction fee!!?,Very disappointed so there is a transaction fee for using PG&E APP?? instead of a discount? What is this? Plus it doesn't tell you that you get charged you just see it at the end after it had processed your payment. Shame on you PG&E THIS IS A VERY CHEAP WAY TO CHEAT PEOPLE  very upset all the other companies and services offer you discounts to download and use their app and what does PG&E DO?? They cheat and charge you without telling you before hand a transaction fee.,1,2016-03-25,Dmoamin,203238994,https://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewUsersUserReviews?userProfileId=203238994
406371748,1348487192,Expecting more out of a fee.,"One-time-99-cents apps do better than this. I pay for this 25% more recurrently (every time I use it) to get an ""Ok"" service. I mean the thing clearly hasn't been updated for ages.

406371748,1352494411,Could be better,Easy to pay your bill however it does not show a past balance nor any bills pay history (past the most recent receipt) etc. it would be better to have the ability to view statements or see messages such as the mail stuffers received if I enrolled in paper statements.

406371748,1346553041,I love this app,I tried paying my bill using the automated line but it wouldn't take my card. It was odd because it didn't ask for them expiration date or pin on the back.   It then referred me to a live voice.  James said it appeared to be a system malfunction.  So he tried it he said there seemed to be something wrong with the card  I opened my pg&e app and used a checking account instead and all is right with the world!,5,2016-03-11,neds shuffle,118957545,https://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewUsersUserReviews?userProfileId=118957545
