Target announcements can be set.based on this information. . TARGET ANNOUNCEMENTS.Target announcements can be set for heart rate  speed  pace  or cycling cadence  providing.real time feedback. Targets can be set per activity or per interval. When you are outside your target range  an.announcement gives you feedback  such as ""Increase Speed"" or ""Decrease Heart Rate""  along with your current stats..Targets can be set for the whole workout or to individual intervals. . ZONES.Zones allows for easy selection of target announcement ranges  but more importantly  allows post workout.analysis of performance. Every workout can be analyzed using zones for heart rate  speed  pace  and cycling cadence. For.example  you could see how much time  how much distance  and how many calories were spent while pace is in a certain.range. Zones are configurable to any ranges  and can be applied to any workout  both during and after a workout. . LAP BUTTON.Tap the lap button at any point during a workout to record all of the data up to that point as an.interval  and summarize a dozen different statistics such as time and distance covered  average pace  fastest pace  and.maximum heart rate. . AND MORE.&#10148; Split distance may be configured per activity. .&#10148; Splits/Intervals/Zones may be viewed via a.button on the stopwatch. .&#10148; Easily enable and disable email updates  Twitter  Facebook  and dailymile via a button.on the stopwatch. .&#10148; Dozens more statistics can be viewed in the stopwatch  announced  and listed in Facebook .Twitter  and dailymile. Includes splits and interval statistics. .&#10148; All graphs may now be viewed over time or.distance. Added graphs for heart rate and bike cadence. .&#10148; Calendar summaries may be exported to CSV. .&#10148; An.import URL can be entered in advanced settings for when iOS does not automatically launch our app to handle an import...&#10148; Activities may be set to summarize into other activities  and then viewed using the Summary button in the.Calendar view. .

INTERVAL TRAINING.Interval training allows any kind of interval workout to be easily created and used  from.simple repeated intervals to a complete pyramid interval plan. Intervals can be based on time  distance  reaching a.specific location  or advanced using the lap button. Using text to speech technology  voice prompts for each interval.can be customized to any specific command. Summary statistics for intervals are shown on the iPhone  within Google Maps .and can be exported for further analysis. . ANT  SUPPORT FOR HEART RATE MONITORS  BIKE SPEED  AND BIKE CADENCE.6.0 adds support for the Wahoo Fitness ANT .system (purchased separately)  allowing heart rate monitors and speed/cadence cycling sensors to be employed for.performance measurement and feedback. Unlike other apps that only record sensor data for later analysis  our app.provides a deep implementation and real time feedback. For example  calories are calculated using heart rate and VO2Max.data. Cycling distance  speed  and stop detection are calculated using sensor data. Target announcements can be set.based on this information. . TARGET ANNOUNCEMENTS.Target announcements can be set for heart rate  speed  pace  or cycling cadence  providing.real time feedback. Targets can be set per activity or per interval. When you are outside your target range  an.announcement gives you feedback  such as ""Increase Speed"" or ""Decrease Heart Rate""  along with your current stats..Targets can be set for the whole workout or to individual intervals. . ZONES.Zones allows for easy selection of target announcement ranges  but more importantly  allows post workout.analysis of performance. Every workout can be analyzed using zones for heart rate  speed  pace  and cycling cadence. For.example  you could see how much time  how much distance  and how many calories were spent while pace is in a certain.range. Zones are configurable to any ranges  and can be applied to any workout  both during and after a workout. . LAP BUTTON.Tap the lap button at any point during a workout to record all of the data up to that point as an.interval  and summarize a dozen different statistics such as time and distance covered  average pace  fastest pace  and.maximum heart rate. .

295905460,We apologize for issues you may have encountered in the prior 2.6 update. Unfortunately  the update we pushed out.on Monday in spite of having very  very minimal changes related specifically to iOS8 managed to drag in with it some.unexpected new issues related to jumping from the original code (built on iOS5 and 6) to iOS8. Those issues tended to.manifest themselves in part based on specific user data and scenarios we didn't catch or were unable to catch in.testing.. We have since expanded our beta test group and put this version through more rigorous testing to ensure the bugs.reported on 2.6 are now fixed.. With that being said  we are very near completion of a major Gas Cubby 3.0 update on totally new code and with a.much improved user experience. If you can hang in there with us for just a bit longer we're sure it will be worth the.wait.,2.7,9/22/2014

383790206,":). CRITICAL UPDATE&#8211;PLEAES READ! THIS UPDATE FIXES THE PROBLEM WITH WEB SEARCHES not brining up any results. Please.read this to learn how the new version works. . WHAT HAPPENED? WHY DID THE APP STOP WORKING? Our app used Google's free Image Search feature for the web library.searches. 3rd party apps use what is called an ""API"" to communicate with the Google image feature. On December 1st .Google deprecated (discontinued support for) their free image search API and turned it off  breaking our app's web.searches  causing any web image searches to stop working. . HOW DID YOU FIX IT? Google has replaced their free API with a paid version. However  using Google's new paid API.was not an option for us  as it would cost way more than what we charge for the app  so that was not feasible. So  What.we did was to actually embed the Google Image search web page right into the app. This restores the complete web search.functionality to the app  but behaves a little differently. Please keep reading to understand how the new system.works:.   The Web Library tab has been renamed the Web Search tab and the My Library tab has been renamed to Favorites..   You perform web searches just as before  by either selecting one of the ""featured"" searches (i.e. Happy Birthday .Good Morning  I Miss You  etc.) or entering in what you're looking for (i.e. red corvette  funny baby  etc.)..   Now  however  instead of the results showing up in the normal thumbnail view like it was before (and how it still.works on the Library tab)  it will actually show you the search results in a Google web page. Scroll down to see the.thumbnails  which look better in many ways  as they keep the aspect ratio of the image and show them larger. When you.find one you like  tap on it  and swipe right and left as usual. HOWEVER  and this is the important part  to use one of.the images (to customize  share  crop  etc. )  you HOLD YOUR FINGER DOWN ON THE IMAGE FOR A SECOND and it will pull that.image into the app  so you can customize it  share it  save it  etc..   IMPORTANT! If you hold your finger down on one of the thumbnails  it will only bring in a low resolution version.of the image  and any animations will not play  so be sure and tap on the thumbnail first  so it enlarges to full.resolution  and then hold your finger on that image to pull it into the app. (NOTE:  It may take a second or two for.the full resolution version of the image to download  and you can't pull the image into the app until it has  so if you.hold your finger down for a second or two  and it doesn't pull in  it is likely still getting the high res version  so.just lift your finger and try again.).   Here is a video that shows how this works  if you need help with this:  <a href""http://tinyurl.com/clipishwebsearch"">http://tinyurl.com/clipishwebsearch</a>. Sorry for any inconvenience to you that was caused by Google discontinuing their free image API  but we hope you'll.continue to enjoy the app as always with the changes we've made. Thanks!",10.31,12/11/2015

(It will  however  reset after 10 minutes of being away from the app.).   BUG FIXED:  Fixed an issue where the user sometimes couldn't save a video or sound file to their photo library..   iOS 9.x has a bug where sometimes the Copy and Paste feature won't work (it will not move a copied item to the.keyboard to be pasted). We have coded in a work around into our app to avoid this issue..   Misc. crashing when staring app and other bug fixes.,10.33,2/19/2016

Other fixes and changes:. &#8226; For folks using the personalized MyFeed feature  duplicate stories in the feed should now no longer be an.issue..    &#8226; Sharing content on iPad no longer crashes the app..    &#8226; Comment counts on content should now.reflect reality. We still long for a return to our fantasy world  however..    &#8226; You can now use native iOS copy /.paste functionality within the app..    &#8226; Video pre roll ads can now be paused..    &#8226; Numerous bugs squashed.and memory leaks plugged which should reduce the number of crashes. A little over 99% of our sessions are crash free but.that&#8217;s still 1% of you that aren&#8217;t experiencing the app the way we intended. We&#8217;re very sorry for that and will always.endeavor to get as close to 100% uptime as possible.,4.5.5,11/9/2015
284819997,All  just a couple of quick fixes and updates to the app with this release:. * Fixed an issue with YouTube videos not working properly in some circumstances..* Fixed an issue where some.images were shown in the wrong aspect ratio..* Fixed an issue where the Reviews filter would not show some content.types..* Fixed some small spelling and syntax issues.. Thank you for using the IGN App!,4.5.6,1/14/2016
284819997,This new version contains a number of bug fixes (full list provided below)  but most notably we're working to.remove ads which auto play with video and sound while in the IGN app. Many of our providers have worked with us to.remove these ridiculously annoying ads  but we've also gone so far as to limit or even remove partners who can't abide.by our guidelines. This should hopefully lead to a smoother experience within the IGN app overall. . Other issues handled as part of this release include:. &#8226;  Improved the app's ability to handle rogue .auto playing ads..    &#8226;  Fixed a crash bug that sometimes occurs after a video plays..    &#8226;  Several updates.and fixes were made to our TV metadata which means it's now even easier to find content on television shows within the.app..    &#8226;  Fixed an issue that prevented sign out..    &#8226;  Updated several SDK dependencies. This should be.transparent to most folks  but ensures the app's ability to continue to run smoothly.,4.5.7,3/4/2016
284819997,A faster app experience and few fixes and clean up in this release:. &#8226;  We're working with Twinprime to make the IGN app even faster with their tech now available in this version of.the app..  &#8226;  Fixed a display issue with some long headers plus some design clean up..  &#8226;  Removed (yes  you.heard right    removed) some advertising from the app..  &#8226;  Made disclaimers on some of our remaining ads more.clear.. Thanks  as always  for using the IGN app!,4.5.8,4/25/2016
284819997,In this release we have focused on cleaning up some crash and display bugs for a more stable performance overall..Notable fixes include:. &#8226;  Resolved the issue with some autoplaying videos interrupting pre existing audio streams..  &#8226;  Resolved an.issue with accidental ad clicks when scrolling through the feed too quickly.. Thanks again for using the IGN App!,4.5.9,6/1/2016

553082951,Thanks for reading our release notes!. We&#8217;ve added a new section to every pad listing that&#8217;s called &#8216;Renters who dig this pad.&#8217; Why is this cool? . 1) You can now see renters who liked the pad and check out other pads that they liked on RadPad (maybe you&#8217;ll.discover a pad you haven&#8217;t seen yet!). 2) You'll also know how many other renters have already contacted the landlord  so if you're on the fence about the.place  you'll have more information to help you make a better decision.. We&#8217;ve heard from a lot of you that parts of RadPad seem to be slow at times. You&#8217;re right and part of the reason for.this is our backend.. Recently we completed a huge migration aimed at making RadPad a lot faster. Without getting all technical and stuff .most of the optimizations are in place but we&#8217;re still making improvements. In our last round of speed testing  we found.RadPad to be almost 40% faster loading the feed! . &#8230;.Don&#8217;t forget to leave us a review if you're digging RadPad!

303973225,"&#9733; REMEMBER! High ratings keep us motivated to keep adding features  as well as attracting more users and Matches.for you. :).  Emails and profiles are now tagged with location and device information. This means you can now verify the.location (City and Country) of where a user is ACTUALLY emailing you from  not just from where they ""say"" they are.located in their profile. This helps thwart scammers who say  for example  they live in Los Angeles  CA  but are really.emailing you from some other country. If a user is running this version or later  on every email there will be a new. ""From"" indicator that tells you the actual location the device was located in when sending the email. If the device is.not capable of sending location information (email was sent from the website or the device had Location Services turned.off for the Dating DNA app)  then it will use the user's IP address to best calculate where they are located. For.example  if it says ""From iPhone in: Los Angeles  CA USA"" then you can be certain that the email was sent from an iPhone.that was physically in the LA area when the email was sent. If it says ""From IP in: Los Angeles  CA USA"" then it means.it was sent using an IP address routed via LA. If you want to verify for certain a user's location  tell them to turn on.their Location Services for the DNA app and to email you from within the app. Additionally  this location information.will be displayed in the bottom section of a user's profile  if it's available  so you can view this with Matches .before you even share emails with someone. If you spot a user who has a location listed in their profile which is.drastically different from the verified location information  please flag their profile so we can investigate and remove.them from the system if necessary.. &#9733; NEW!
